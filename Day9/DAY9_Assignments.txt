Note : use the orders dataset for below problems:

1- create a new column in the orders dataframe with name profit_flag. Set its value as 1 if profit is greater than 0 else set 0.

2- in the orders data frame rename column names to upper case ..eg order_id should be ORDER_ID

3- again change the column names back to lower case

4- sort the dataframe column by profit in descending order 

5- sort the dataframe column by sales in ascending order , in case of a tie it should be sorted by profit in descending order 

6- reset the index to original state

7- create a column as profit_category . sets it value as below:

if profit < 0 then 'loss'
if profit between 0 and 100 then 'low profit' 
if profit between 100 and 500 then 'medium profit'
else high profit 

8- create a new column sales_profit_ratio and set its value as (profit/sales)*100

9- find all the orders where customer name starts with 'D' and ends with 'e'

10- create a new column order_year and populate it with year of order_date. ( hint : use the series objects slice method )

11 - delete column sales_profit_ratio from the dataframe

12- delete all the rows where profit is negative
